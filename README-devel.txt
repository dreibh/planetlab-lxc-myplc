we do not support myplc-devel anymore, see build/ for how to build the system in a vserver-based environment

I am removing all files related to the former myplc-devel, they can be
retrieved in revision 7249:

D      plc_devel_config.xml
D      build_devel.sh
D      myplc-devel-native.spec
D      myplc-devel.spec
D      plc-devel.sysconfig
